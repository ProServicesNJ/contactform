# contactform
First PHP Project

Requirements
The form should consist of:

A text input for user’s name
A text input for user’s email address
A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
A text area for user’s comment
The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
There are more optional conditions to add challenge and/or better functionality to your form below
Extra challenge:

Make the text area a WYSIWYG. (Use Summernote or CKEditor for example).
Add an edit button to the second page, send the data back to the form, and autofill the data back into the fields.
If you would like to practice more with databases, add a submit button on the second page which will save the response to a database table.
